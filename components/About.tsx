          I Live Dreaming is an album of collaboratively interpreted American
          standards and original compositions. Since meeting in New York City
          nearly a decade ago, pianist Russell Kranes, bassist Sam Weber,
          guitarist Alex Levine, and drummer Jay Sawyer have formed a collective
          musical identity through thousands of hours of performance across a
          vast array of musical contexts. Having all studied with musical
          masters, including Geri Allen, Robert Hurst, Rodney Jones, Fred
          Hersch, and Billy Hart, I Live Dreaming is both an homage to the
          tradition and a fresh approach to creative composition. Each of the
          four musicians strive to impart spirit and honesty with the hope that
          each listener can discover a deeper connection with their own
          conception of lifeâ€™s beauty.
